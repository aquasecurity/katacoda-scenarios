# Installation

You can find all installation options in the [documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.23.0/getting-started/installation/).

We are going to use the Ubuntu-based installation for this example. Upon starting the scenario, the following commands got executed in a script inside the terminal:

```
cat foreground.sh
```

Trivy should now be ready to go in your katacoda environment.

You can make sure that everything works through checking the Trivy version:
```
trivy --version
```{{execute}}
